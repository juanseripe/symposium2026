description: >
  In a context where academic work is accelerating and becoming more fragmented, where collegiality and solidarity are declining, and where inequalities and psychological health issues are on the rise, it seems necessary to create inclusive and safe spaces to take a step back and collectively rethink the academic ecosystem. With this in mind, this reflective workshop will first focus on the factors that can exacerbate psychological health issues in graduate studies, placing them in the broader context of the managerialization of the university. Then, drawing on the principles of “slow scholarship,” we will reflect together on strategies for taking care of our physical and mental health, but also for rediscovering meaning and pleasure in intellectual work and writing.

  Please note: the slides will be in English and the presentation will mainly be in French (with the possibility of rephrasing as needed and answering questions in English without any problem).
