    paper_title: "A Friend in Need is a Friend Indeed: Friendshoring and Geopolitical Alignment in International Public Procurement"
    paper_summary: >
      Although trading with geopolitically aligned partners - commonly referred to as friendshoring - is widely advocated as a risk-mitigation tool, the extent and circumstances under which this practice is employed have received limited scholarly attention. Even more so, the distinction between its occurrence in public and private sector procurement in the context of geopolitics and economic security merits a timely examination. Using data from inter-country input-output tables tallied with country voting behaviour in the UN for the period 1995-2020, we demonstrate that friendshoring is more pronounced in public procurement than in private procurement. We further document that it is particularly salient in sectors that are considered strategically salient for a state’s national interest. Our findings further show that friendshoring in public procurement has systematically intensified across the globe since the Great Recession of 2008-2009.

    paper_title: "Généalogie des dispositifs de gouvernementalité du développement durable et place de la comptabilité"
    paper_summary: >
      Cet article analyse la manière dont la durabilité est construite et gouvernée à travers des dispositifs comptables et de gestion. Il mobilise la littérature qui analyse les formes de gouvernement de la durabilité - qui se résume en fait à l’environnement - à partir du concept de gouvernementalité développé par Michel Foucault. Les résultats dressent une catégorisation par période qui mobilise ces formes de gouvernement à partir des discours (du dit), instruments (du non-dit) et dispositifs (du dit et du non-dit) historiques de durabilité. Les instruments comptables jouent ainsi un rôle central dans la mise en visibilité des enjeux environnementaux et dans la formation de régimes de gouvernementalité compatibles avec l’idéologie néolibérale. L’article affirme que la période contemporaine se caractérise par un régime de marchandisation de la durabilité, et discute des implications de ce régime, entre durabilité économique et soutenabilité écologique.

    paper_title: "The role of rapport between coaches and founders: Introducing management controls to startup founders in incubator programs"
    paper_summary: > 
      Open Access (OA) mandates are new institutional policies designed to facilitate free knowledge dissemination, yet they introduce financial barriers that may interact with existing gender disparities in scientific production. In this paper, I examine the gendered consequences of these ostensibly neutral mandates, focusing on whether they serve as a leveling process for female researchers. For this purpose, I draw on a longitudinal study of 110,166 publications from two major teaching hospitals in Quebec during 2008-2024, utilizing a difference-in-differences (DID) design to analyze the impact of the 2015 Canadian OA policy and 2019 Quebec OA policy. I find that while both OA policies increase overall adoption, they catalyze a heterogeneous response where female first authors exhibit a significantly stronger increase in OA adoption than their male counterparts immediately following the policy. Furthermore, my study explains female first authors’ response as a form of immediate compliance driven by their heightened need for legitimacy in response to institutional pressures, as this gender difference diminishes over time. With these findings, I contribute to the literature on gender inequality in science and open innovation.

    paper_title: "Taking Agency, Values, and Interest Seriously: The Role of Top Managers and Regulators in Decoupling"
    paper_summary: >
      Isomorphism and decoupling are the two central arguments in the neo-institutional theory of organizations. While the former emphasizes diffusion and similarity in structure and practices across organizations within the same field, the latter implies agency, values, and interests in an organization’s responses to institutional pressures. The paper offers a conceptual clarification of decoupling, based on which it advances two novel constructs, top managers’ perceived costs of decoupling and top managers’ value incompatibility, to explain the likelihood of decoupling. Further, the paper proposes regulative decoupling as a distal construct that influences top managers’ perceived costs of decoupling. Two key process mechanisms, top managers’ sense-giving and ceremonial enforcing, are proposed to explicate the proposed relationships. The paper is, above all, an attempt to elaborate the conception of decoupling.
