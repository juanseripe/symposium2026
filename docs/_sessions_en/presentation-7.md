    paper_title: "A Friend in Need is a Friend Indeed: Friendshoring and Geopolitical Alignment in International Public Procurement"
    paper_summary: >
      Although trading with geopolitically aligned partners - commonly referred to as friendshoring - is widely advocated as a risk-mitigation tool, the extent and circumstances under which this practice is employed have received limited scholarly attention. Even more so, the distinction between its occurrence in public and private sector procurement in the context of geopolitics and economic security merits a timely examination. Using data from inter-country input-output tables tallied with country voting behaviour in the UN for the period 1995-2020, we demonstrate that friendshoring is more pronounced in public procurement than in private procurement. We further document that it is particularly salient in sectors that are considered strategically salient for a state’s national interest. Our findings further show that friendshoring in public procurement has systematically intensified across the globe since the Great Recession of 2008-2009.

    paper_title: "Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07 and Earnings Management: Evidence from Sepment Reporting"
    paper_summary: >
      This study explores how the introduction of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07 reshapes firms’ earnings management behavior through changes in segment reporting. Using U.S. multi-segment firms from 2010–2025, this study examines ASU 2023-07 as an exogenous regulatory shock and applies a difference-in-differences design to assess whether enhanced transparency constrains managerial discretion or induces substitution across earnings management channels. I document three main findings. First, firms with more highly decoupled segment profit measures exhibit significantly higher abnormal accruals in the post-ASU period, indicating a shift toward accrual-based earnings management when segment-level discretion is limited. Second, I observe no evidence of a corresponding increase in real earnings management, suggesting that managers prefer more flexible, reporting-stage adjustments over costly operational actions. Third, although classification shifting between operating segments and corporate/other segments persists, the incremental impact of ASU 2023-07 on this behavior is limited in the short run. Overall, the results suggest that enhanced segment disclosure improves transparency but does not eliminate opportunistic reporting; instead, it reallocates earnings management across reporting channels. These findings contribute to the segment reporting and earnings management literature by providing the early empirical evidence of the consequences of ASU 2023-07 and have important implications for regulators, investors, and standard setters evaluating the effectiveness of disclosure-based reforms.

    paper_title: "Taking Agency, Values, and Interest Seriously: The Role of Top Managers and Regulators in Decoupling"
    paper_summary: >
      Isomorphism and decoupling are the two central arguments in the neo-institutional theory of organizations. While the former emphasizes diffusion and similarity in structure and practices across organizations within the same field, the latter implies agency, values, and interests in an organization’s responses to institutional pressures. The paper offers a conceptual clarification of decoupling, based on which it advances two novel constructs, top managers’ perceived costs of decoupling and top managers’ value incompatibility, to explain the likelihood of decoupling. Further, the paper proposes regulative decoupling as a distal construct that influences top managers’ perceived costs of decoupling. Two key process mechanisms, top managers’ sense-giving and ceremonial enforcing, are proposed to explicate the proposed relationships. The paper is, above all, an attempt to elaborate the conception of decoupling.
