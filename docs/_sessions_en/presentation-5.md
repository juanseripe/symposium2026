    paper_title: "Playing the Jigsaw Time Games: Enacting Temporal Knowing in Interprofessional Coordination"
    paper_summary: >
      This study aims to advance research on knowing and professional expertise, which has predominantly emphasized know-how and distinction-drawing, by foregrounding knowing-when as a critical yet understudied dimension of knowing practices. I conceptualize knowing-when as actors’ tacit understanding of organizational rhythms, colleagues’ temporal habits, appropriate action timing, an important dimension that also enables the enactment of domain expertise. Based on a 16-month ethnographic field study in a Level-1 trauma center and its emergency department (ED) in Canada, I identify three interdependent practices through which professionals enact knowing-when, including mobilizing awareness of temporal context, anticipatory knowing, and temporal gaming. Through these practices, professionals not only meet situational demands of their own work, but also align their own actions with other workers’ expectations and organizational temporal rhythms, therefore sustaining coordination of interdependent work. On the other hand, while these “time games” may expand professionals’ discretion to secure critical resources and more time, they can simultaneously strain inter-unit relationships and complicate temporal coordination patterns. In sum, this paper highlights knowing-when as a critical resourcing mechanism, enabling professionals to “do more with less” particularly in a resource-constrained environment.

    paper_title: "Let Me Give You Some Advice: How mentors in entrepreneurship accelerators help reduce subjective uncertainty"
    paper_summary: >
      Uncertainty presents a challenge to early-stage entrepreneurship because it can hinder entrepreneurial decision-making and action in opportunity enactment. Receiving advice from knowledgeable others, such as mentors, is a key way entrepreneurs seek to reduce uncertainty and overcome barriers to decision-making and action. However, the mechanisms within entrepreneurial advice remain unexplained, and scholars have yet to discover how mentoring in these settings helps founders reduce uncertainty. To explore this process, I conducted a two-year ethnography in an entrepreneurship accelerator, and find that mentors often invoke expectations by investors for founder behavior and performance. Using a discursive approach, I zoom in on 283 moments within mentor-founder discussions in which mentors invoke investors’ expectations. Within these moments I found that mentors adopted a series of what I call discursive moves: exemplifying, evaluating, consequentializing, asserting, and directing. Embedded in the discursive moves are evaluative criteria and distinctive mechanisms and I theorize that they collectively function as a disciplining power, which, in turn, recalibrates founders’ expectations and steers behavior. In effect, discursive moves encourage founders to align their choices with investor expectations, thereby maintaining a normative order that reduces subjective uncertainty for both founders and investors.

    paper_title: "Supervisor–Employee Identity Negotiations: A Self-Determination Theory Perspective"
    paper_summary: >
      We integrate Identity Negotiation Theory and Self-Determination Theory (SDT) to examine how supervisor–employee identity processes influence work outcomes. We propose a novel 2×2 typology of supervisor–employee identity negotiation styles based on each party’s self-esteem orientation. Across the four dyads – Fast Growth (both have secure, noncontingent self-esteem), Supervisor-Pending Growth (insecure supervisor, secure employee), Employee-Pending Growth (secure supervisor, insecure employee), and Halt (both insecure) – we identify distinct identity negotiation dynamics and outcomes. We show how noncontingent (secure) versus contingent (insecure) self-esteem drives motivations for congruence or conflict, drawing on SDT’s concepts of autonomous versus controlled regulation. Each quadrant is defined and illustrated with examples in terms of identity affirmation, motivation, and expected performance and well-being. We discuss how this framework extends the identity, leadership, and SDT literatures by highlighting the interpersonal negotiation of identity under varying conditions of need satisfaction. Finally, we outline practical implications for supervisors and HR (e.g., fostering autonomy-supportive leadership) and suggest future research to test and refine the typology.

    paper_title: "The (un)ethical bystander: moving beyond the action-inaction dichotomy in ethical dilemmas"
    paper_summary: >
      This study examines the ethics of bystanders in non-emergency ethical scenarios, focusing on how individuals intend to act, or remain passive, and how they justify their choices. The bystander effect explains why individuals may fail to act or provide support in emergency situations. Failing to act in such situations may create moral distress, though individuals may attempt to rationalize their behavior by utilizing moral disengagement mechanisms. The moral disengagement theory enlightens us on the cognitive processes that allow individuals to deactivate self-sanction, enabling them to engage in unethical behavior while feeling morally safe. Using vignette-based interviews with business school students, we propose a two-axis framework distinguishing behavioral outcomes (action vs. inaction) from justification orientation (others-oriented, self-oriented), yielding four behavior-justification pairs. This framework positions ethical bystanders along a continuum of moral engagement that moves beyond the traditional action-inaction dichotomy. This continuum captures intermediate states such as self-interested action and engaged inaction. We also describe how belief-action misalignment can produce moral distress and how individuals may engage in partial action as a way to reduce that moral tension, a process we term moral settlement.
