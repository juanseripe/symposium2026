description: >
  Brainstorming is widely taught in management education, yet students often underestimate how constraint
  calibration, emotions, and group dynamics shape which ideas get generated, selected, and retained.
  Alphabet of Chaos is a 90-minute arts-based classroom workshop in which students create 4-5 visual variants
  of a randomly assigned letter under shared constraints, then converge through peer selection to build a collective
  chaotic alphabet – an analog to an idea wall – used as an artifact for a structured product-process-person debrief.
  Students leave able to generate multiple ideas, analyze how constraints and group dynamics shape brainstorming
  outcomes, and articulate their creative inhibitions and confidence.
