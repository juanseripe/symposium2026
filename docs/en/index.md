Each year, the Doctoral Symposium brings together PhD students from Montreal’s four business schools around what unites us most: a shared passion for research. More than an academic event, it is a moment of collegiality and connection. A space where participants can
exchange with peers who face similar challenges, yet evolve within their school’s distinct academic traditions. The symposium also offers a valuable opportunity to build lasting relationships, expand one’s network, and meet those who may well become future collaborators. It provides a supportive environment to practice an essential dimension of academic life: scientific communication. Finally, it strengthens ties across the four business schools and allows us to fully leverage the richness of our joint program by cultivating a strong, diverse, and inspiring scholarly community.

With this spirit in mind, the Doctoral Symposium will return for its 5th edition on **March 12–13, 2026**, at **HEC Montréal, in the Hélène-Desmarais building**. For this edition, we have designed three complementary formats that we hope will enable everyone to participate fully in the event: **(1) oral presentations**, **(2) roundtable discussions**, and **(3) workshops**.

### Hosting Institution – HEC Montréal

Founded in 1907, **HEC Montréal** is one of Canada’s leading business schools and an internationally recognized institution for research and graduate education.  
Hosting the 2026 PhD Annual Symposium reflects HEC Montréal’s commitment to doctoral training, academic excellence, and collaboration across institutions.

We acknowledge that HEC Montréal is located on Indigenous territory that has been colonised. Historically, Tiohtiá:ke \| Mooniyang \| Montreal was a gathering place for various First Nations, and today, a diverse population of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people live there.
