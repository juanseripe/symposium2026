#### Childcare

If you need childcare, you may register your child (**6 months to 11 years old**) for the **CSPE UQAM** drop-in childcare service located near the Hélène-Desmarais Building. Childcare is available on **Thursday** and **Friday**, as well as for the **Thursday evening cocktail (5 à 7)**. If there is sufficient demand, childcare may also be offered for the **Friday evening 5 à 7**.

Childcare fees will be **covered by the Symposium** (please make sure to check **“Doctoral Symposium 2026”** in the form).

**Registration:** [registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfCQdXtRiFbNS8w27ne6bu8X7nRzcSdDsGALgLxg93VWCmB6g/viewform)

#### Religious fasting

The conference takes place during religious fasting periods. At the end of each day (**Thursday** and **Friday**), food and beverages will be served during the end-of-day cocktail so participants may break their fast if they wish.

---

#### Gender-neutral restrooms

While building signage at the Hélène-Desmarais Building cannot be changed, some single-occupancy restrooms originally designated as accessible are **gender-neutral** and may be used by anyone.
