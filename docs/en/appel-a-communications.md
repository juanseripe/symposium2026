The 2026 Doctoral Symposium offers **three complementary formats** to help everyone participate fully in the event.

---

### 1) Oral Presentation (full paper)

Oral presentations are the classic format of scientific communications. They provide a friendly setting to practice a core academic skill.

Presentations are short (**15–20 minutes**) and may cover a **methodological, conceptual, or empirical** paper that is still in progress or close to completion, followed by a **Q&A / feedback** period.

**Submission requirement:** a text of at least **5,000 words**.

Accepted submissions will be grouped by theme. Each participant will be assigned a peer’s paper to read in advance and will provide **more in-depth feedback (≈ 5 minutes)** during the Symposium.

---

### 2) Roundtable (extended abstract)

Roundtables are designed for participants who wish to present more early-stage projects or take part in thematic discussions without developing a full written paper.

**Submission requirement:** an extended abstract of **up to 2 pages** (or **max. 1,000 words**).

Proposals will be grouped by theme and shared in advance within each group. On the day of the Symposium, each participant will have about **15 minutes** to briefly present their ideas (optionally with **1–2 slides**) and engage in discussion with peers.

---

### 3) Workshops

A workshop track is also offered as an **interactive** space to share knowledge and develop skills related to doctoral life and academic development more broadly (e.g., methodological tools, work organization, academic writing, career management, etc.).

Workshops may be led by **PhD students** or by **invited faculty**. Priority will be given to **dynamic, participatory, and applied** formats (demonstrations, hands-on exercises, guided discussions, etc.).

**Workshop proposal (initial idea) should include:**
1. the general topic;  
2. learning objectives;  
3. planned activities;  
4. preferred format (student-led workshop or proposal to invite a professor);  
5. an approximate outline of the session.

If you plan to invite a professor to lead the workshop, you are encouraged to contact them directly to confirm interest and availability. Proposals will be evaluated based on their relevance to the doctoral community, feasibility, and interactivity.

- Submissions will **not be published or disseminated**. They will only be shared with the person assigned to provide feedback for the **oral presentation** format. In other words, you may confidently submit a paper you plan to present at a conference—the Symposium is an excellent opportunity to prepare for that presentation.  
- Submissions may be made **in French or in English**.
